Machine learning models learn by looking at examples. In supervised learning, there is a known outcome, or label, and by looking at examples of data across many, many examples, a relationship established between the data and the label. More examples makes it easier for the model to find patterns; fewer examples makes it more difficult to learn, and hence, leads to worse performance.
